# Cybersecurity-Lab-SIEM - Detection, Response & Automation

This lab simulates a real-world SOC environment from end-to-end: endpoint telemetry ingestion, custom detection engineering, automated case creation, IOC analysis and active response.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 - Infrastructure
Deployed all services (TheHive, Cortex, Shuffle, MISP) utilising Docker containers in an Ubuntu Server VM (`soc-core`). Configured an isolated VirtualBox NAT network (`soc-net`, `10.0.5.0/24`) with port-forwarding rules to access the services on the host.

### Phase 2 - Endpoint Configuration
Deployed a **Windows 11** VM and an **Ubuntu Server** VM as Wazuh agents. Installed Sysmon with the SwiftOnSecurity config on the Windows machine and configured Wazuh to ingest `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` event channel logs.

### Phase 3 - Integrations
Connected all tools:
- **TheHive ↔ Cortex** - observables analysis within cases
- **TheHive ↔ MISP** - bidirectional IOC sharing 
- **Wazuh → Shuffle** - webhook-based alert forwarding for SOAR triggers
- **Cortex analyzers enabled:** VirusTotal, URLhaus, Abuse Finder, FileInfo

### Phase 4 - Detection Engineering
Wrote custom Wazuh rules in `local_rules.xml` targeting:
- Suspicious PowerShell download cradles (T1105)
- Scheduled task creation via command line (T1053.005)
- Registry Run key modification (T1547.001)

### Phase 5 - SOAR Automation
Built an end-to-end Shuffle workflow triggered by Wazuh webhooks:

```
Endpoints (Win / Ubuntu)
      ↓ sends events
Wazuh SIEM
      ↓ detects & alerts
Shuffle SOAR
      ↓ receives webhook — parses JSON (rule, agent, command data)
Regex node extracts SHA256 hash from Sysmon event
      ↓
Cortex queries VirusTotal for the hash
      ↓
TheHive alert created with host info and VT score
      ↓
Condition: VT malicious count > 3?
      ↓ YES
Wazuh active response isolates the host
      ↓
SOC analyst reviews the TheHive alert             
```

### Phase 6 - Adversary Simulation & Validation
Used **Atomic Red Team** to simulate real attacks mapped to MITRE ATT&CK:

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1105 -TestNumbers 10       # Suspicious PowerShell download
Invoke-AtomicTest T1547.001 -TestNumbers 1    # Registry Run key modification
Invoke-AtomicTest T1053.005 -TestNumbers 1    # Scheduled task creation
```

Validated the full pipeline: Wazuh detects → Shuffle triggers → Cortex enriches → TheHive alert fires → host isolated.
